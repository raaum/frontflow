#frontflow
A starter application that serves as an example of how to accomplish some common frontend tasks and workflows and improve your development.

Write better code and deploy your apps more easily and efficiently by processing your Sass, Compass, and CoffeeScript sources at the development stage, prior to production, using Gulp, Git, and Browserify.

## Features
- Uses the latest npm sources
- Processes tasks with Gulp
- Imports libraries with Browserify
- Incorporates Sass and Compass
- Issues tasks in sequence
- Watches changes to files
- Adds environmental variables
- Adds static reloads
- Minifies your JavaScript
- Minifies your HTML

##Note
You need to have Ruby and Compass installed and in your system PATH to initialize this project.  If you have no clue what that means, just use the sources as an example of how to construct your own workflow.
